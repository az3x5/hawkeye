# Implementation Status

Authoritative record of what is built. One phase at a time; a phase is only
marked complete when its acceptance criteria have been verified by running
them.

Last updated: 2026-08-18.

## Phase 0 — Foundation & Contracts — ✅ COMPLETE

Repository skeleton, configuration, error envelope, structured logging,
readiness registry, architectural seams, container topology, and the
lint/type/test toolchain.

### Delivered

| Item | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Environment-driven settings, required DSNs, no in-code credentials | `backend/app/core/config.py` |
| Structured error envelope + handlers (domain, validation, HTTP) | `backend/app/core/errors.py` |
| JSON logging with biometric-field stripping | `backend/app/core/logging.py` |
| Readiness probe registry | `backend/app/core/readiness.py` |
| `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/readyz` with schemas | `backend/app/api/v1/health.py` |
| Application factory | `backend/app/main.py` |
| `ModelAdapter` seam (name/version/preprocessing_version/warmup) | `backend/app/adapters/base.py` |
| `StorageConnector` seam (provider/ping) | `backend/app/connectors/base.py` |
| Postgres + Redis + Qdrant topology, Qdrant unpublished | `docker-compose.yml` |
| ruff + mypy(strict) + pytest configuration | `backend/pyproject.toml` |

### Acceptance criteria — verified

| Criterion | How verified | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service starts and answers liveness | `docker compose up`, `curl /api/v1/health` | ✅ `{"status":"ok",...}` HTTP 200 |
| Readiness reflects real probe state, no false "healthy" | unit tests + live `curl /api/v1/readyz` | ✅ `{"status":"ready","checks":[]}`; failing probe → 503 |
| Missing dependency configuration fails startup | `tests/test_config.py` | ✅ ValidationError names `postgres_dsn`, `redis_dsn` |
| All errors use the structured envelope | `tests/test_errors.py` + live 404 | ✅ envelope on 404/422/503 |
| Biometric material cannot reach logs | `tests/test_logging.py` | ✅ all `SENSITIVE_KEYS` stripped |
| Seams free of HTTP coupling | `tests/test_seams.py` | ✅ no framework imports in adapters/connectors |
| Qdrant not reachable from the host | `curl 127.0.0.1:6333` vs. in-container fetch | ✅ refused from host, 200 inside network |
| Lint, types and tests clean | ruff, mypy --strict, pytest | ✅ 20 passed, 0 lint errors, 0 type errors |

### Deliberately NOT in Phase 0

No domain model, no database schema or migrations, no Qdrant collections, no
SCRFD, no AdaFace, no embeddings, no enrolment, no matching, no thresholds, no
audit log, no frontend. `app/domain/` is intentionally empty.

## Phase 1 — Person & Face Domain + Persistence — ⬜ NOT STARTED

Planned: `person_uuid` domain model, external `id` / `local_id` as scoped
attributes, face-sample entities supporting many samples per person, Postgres
schema and migrations, the Postgres `StorageConnector` implementation, and its
registration as a readiness probe.

## Phase 2 — Detection (SCRFD adapter) — ⬜ NOT STARTED
## Phase 3 — Recognition (AdaFace adapter) + embedding provenance — ⬜ NOT STARTED
## Phase 4 — Qdrant connector + vector storage — ⬜ NOT STARTED
## Phase 5 — Idempotent enrolment + Redis jobs — ⬜ NOT STARTED
## Phase 6 — Identity decision layer, configurable thresholds, audit log — ⬜ NOT STARTED
## Phase 7 — Next.js + TypeScript review frontend — ⬜ NOT STARTED

## Known issues

- `docker compose build` cannot reach PyPI in this sandbox (DNS is unavailable
  to the default bridge network at build time). The image builds with
  `docker build --network=host -t faceid-api:dev ./backend`, and the compose
  file pins `image: faceid-api:dev` so `docker compose up -d --no-build` uses
  it. This is an environment limitation, not a defect in the Dockerfile; on a
  normal host `docker compose up --build` works unchanged.
